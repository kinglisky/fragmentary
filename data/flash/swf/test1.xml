			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://www.mtv.com/shared/promoimages/bands/n/nate_dogg/281x211.jpg" alt="Nate Dogg" align="right" /><b>&#183;</b>  Nate Dogg has been hit with three felony counts of making criminal threats and stalking, plus a misdemeanor charge of driving on a suspended license for a June 20 incident in which he <a href="http://www.sohh.com/2008/07/news-nate-dogg.html" target="_new">allegedly menaced his ex-wife</a> on a Los Angeles highway.</p>
<p><b>&#183;</b> We already knew Oasis&#8217; Noel Gallagher wasn&#8217;t too keen on shaking things up at Glastonbury with a headlining spot for Jay-Z, but now he&#8217;s proven to be resistant to change in other ways. He&#8217;s said you <a href="http://thelondonpaper.typepad.com/thelondonblog/2008/07/gallagher-dig-o.html" target="_new">shouldn&#8217;t expect a Radiohead-esque album giveaway</a> for the band&#8217;s upcoming <i>Dig Out Your Soul.</i> In fact, he expects to make his money back, because that thing was hella expensive to record!</p>
<p><b>&#183;</b> You&#8217;ve probably heard that while CD sales have taken a nosedive, vinyl record sales have been on the upswing since 2004. Now major retailer Best Buy is following Circuit City&#8217;s lead by launching a program to <a href="http://www.startribune.com/business/22846884.html?location_refer=Business" target="_new">stock some vinyl in its stores</a>.<span id="more-1345"></span></p>
<p><b>&#183;</b> In other vinyl news, Capitol Records will rerelease eight classic titles, all of which were previously out of print on vinyl &#8212; and six of which will be newly remastered on limited-edition 180 gram LPs &#8212; on August 19. The albums include Coldplay&#8217;s <i>Parachutes</i> and <i>A Rush of Blood to the Head;</i> A Perfect Circle&#8217;s <i>Mer de Noms;</i> Radiohead&#8217;s <i>OK Computer,</i> <i>Kid A,</i> <i>Amnesiac</i> and <i>Hail to the Thief;</i> and the Steve Miller Band&#8217;s <i>Greatest Hits.</i></p>
<p><b>&#183;</b> Who&#8217;s the next great &#8217;90s alt-rock band to reunite? In addition to their previously announced set at the Virgin Mobile Festival, art rockers Shudder to Think will play at least eight more dates, beginning <a href="http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/news/141894-shudder-to-think-announce-reunion-tour" target="_new">September 9 in Chicago</a>. </p>
<p><b>&#183;</b> How much would you pay to see Bon Jovi play a show in New York&#8217;s Central Park this Saturday? If you&#8217;re a hard-core fan, as much as <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5iMai7DJVvZIkIMrt7F2m6HE9aYgAD91PN98G9" target="_new">$1,500 a ticket</a> &#8230; even though the show is free.</p>
<p><b>&#183;</b> The biggest solar-powered concert in San Diego&#8217;s history, the third annual <a href="http://www.stayclassy.org/" target="_new">Stay Classy Tailgate</a>, will take place on July 12 with a headlining set by the Flobots.</p>

We may have witnessed the first-ever recorded instance of a musician taking wardrobe hints from a leprechaun when we hit the set of All Time Low&#8217;s video for &#8220;Poppin&#8217; Champagne&#8221; last week.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>By Brittany Baugh</i></p>
<p><img src="http://www.mtv.com/shared/promoimages/bands/a/all_time_low/newsroom_070708/281x211.jpg" align="left" />We may have witnessed the first-ever recorded instance of a musician taking wardrobe hints from a leprechaun when we hit the set of All Time Low&#8217;s video for &#8220;Poppin&#8217; Champagne&#8221; last week. When frontman Alex Gaskarth saw the green-and-gold suit, complete with buckled shoes and a tiny hat, he remarked, &#8220;Hey! We should have gotten me fitted for a matching one!&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to the leprechauns, we also saw zoot suits, ferrets and booty dancing on the set at New York&#8217;s Touch nightclub. For anyone who&#8217;s followed the band, it was business as usual, but it was, of course, just that &#8212; business. No, the life of a music-video extra is not a glamorous one.</p>
<p>(After the jump, check out my exclusive footage of bassist Zack Merrick!)<br />
<span id="more-1344"></span><br />
More than 120 potential extras showed up at 9 a.m., but the guys only needed 60 for the shoot. If you showed up early enough and looked the part (i.e. had a ridiculous, funky outfit on, complete with fake bling), you were privileged enough to take a seat in a warm, crowded room and wait &#8230; and wait &#8230; and wait. It felt like the band shot their performance at least 50 times as cameras caught them from every angle imaginable.<br />
<center><br />
<embed src="http://www.mtv.com/player/embed/wp/" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowFullScreen="true" FlashVars="CONFIG_URL=/player/embed/wp/configuration.jhtml%3fvid%3D255568&allowFullScreen=true" width="400" height="330" AllowScriptAccess="never" base="." /></center></p>
<p>But the extras didn&#8217;t have it the hardest: Alex accidentally gashed bassist Zack Merrick in the head with his guitar during one take (yes, there was blood). There was only a brief break before the band picked up right where they left off.</p>
<p>Being on the set was not without its rewards. We made friends with other die-hard ATL fans and fantasized about our 10 seconds of fame. And then there was the free lunch &#8212; at 2 p.m., pizza arrived &#8230; for some of us. The six pizzas ran out pretty fast; everyone else had to leave the set to grab food. An hour or so after lunch, it was finally our time to shine! The female extras (who were hip-hop-ified by the lovely on-site hair, makeup and wardrobe staff) huddled around the band in rainbow formation, ready to shake it for the camera. Believe it or not, dancing in a tightly packed space filled with cameras can be a little uncomfortable.</p>
<p>When the shoot wrapped, the band members made sure to thank us personally and even happily took requests for pictures and autographs. The boys were personable and outgoing, and at one point Alex &#8220;knighted&#8221; me with a prop pimp cane! All in all, I think the guaranteed embarrassment is a fair trade for the bragging rights of actually being in a music video. The video should arrive later this month. Be sure to check it out, and remember all the blood, sweat and tears that went into it.</p>

<p>OK, so I&#8217;ll get right into this one, because honestly there is no other way to approach such a subject: Can someone please tell me what is up with the white suit?!? I mean, has it made an official comeback, and I&#8217;m just not aware? Did the world lose all its blue and black fabric? Was there an overstock of boat shoes and we needed to find matching outfits?!</p>

<p>Early this morning, as we prepared for our interview with one of my favorites of all time, Val Kilmer, I never expected to spend the first 10 minutes wondering why the Iceman insisted on bringing back the icy whites. It&#8217;s the second time this summer that one of my favorite actors went all Don Johnson. The other was <a href="http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1588216/story.jhtml">Jean-Claude Van Damme</a>. (Joke all you want, but you can&#8217;t tell me &#8220;Bloodsport&#8221; is not a classic, people.)</p>
<p>Now, I don&#8217;t usually drift into <i>Us Weekly</i> territory, but we&#8217;re pretty sure they&#8217;re not on this one, so we have to ask: </p>
<p>Who wore it best? Val or Jean-Claude? Tell us what you think.</p>

<p>It is not often enough that you see a young black woman in pristine slacks, dress shirt, bowtie, cumber bun and saddle shoes stage dive into a crowd and start a mosh pit.</p>
<p>This past weekend, producer Tami Katzoff and I found ourselves in the thick of <a href="http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1585050/20080408/monae__janelle.jhtml">Janelle Monáe&#8217;s</a> set at the fourth annual <a href="http://www.afropunk.com/" target="_blank">Afro-Punk Festival</a>, where she joined other amazing musicians, graffiti muralists, BMX riders and skateboarders at the Brooklyn Academy of Music.</p>
<p>Afro-Punk, an annual event showcasing groundbreaking bands, films and artists, was created by Matthew Morgan and James Spooner, who also made the 2003 documentary &#8220;Afro-Punk,&#8221; which chronicles the subculture. Despite all of the raw energy that is present at the fest, AP still manages to be a safe, family-friendly event where participants are encouraged to register to vote at one of the many community booths. </p>
<p>The highlight of Saturday&#8217;s AP events was when Janelle closed the show by diving into the audience, crowd-surfing into the middle of everyone and then forming a mosh pit with her fans. She then ran through the crowd, climbed back onstage where she went berserk, Iggy Pop/ David Bowie-style, and slammed her mic stand on the ground, threw water at the crowd and then ran off again, leaving the crowd screaming for more. What a show-woman!</p>
<p>Watch space girl sensation Janelle Monáe crowd surfing in true punk rock fashion after the jump!<br />

<embed src="http://www.mtv.com/player/embed/wp/" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowFullScreen="true" FlashVars="CONFIG_URL=/player/embed/wp/configuration.jhtml%3fvid%3D255356&allowFullScreen=true" width="400" height="330" AllowScriptAccess="never" base="." /><p>I don&#8217;t want to give away all of our exclusives from the festival (stay tuned for more news, videos, articles and photos in our upcoming festival coverage), but I will say that Janelle Monáe thrilled her audience (and me) with all of the songs from her upcoming album, <i>Metropolis: Suite I,</i> in stores August 12. Being up onstage with her was out of this world &#8212; even though I was focused on shooting her without getting in the way. She&#8217;s tiny but her dance moves take up the entire stage! I could still feel the energy from the crowd below me building to a frenzy. By the time she did her last encore, there was so much gold-tinged smoke enveloping me that combined with her futuristic, spacey songs and otherworldly dance moves, I felt like I was on another planet. </p>
<p>Check back here later this week for all of our Afro-Punk coverage!</p>

<p><b>&#183;</b> Steve-O is back in the &#8220;looney bin,&#8221; according to <a href="http://blog.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&#038;friendID=2231003&#038;blogID=411557675" target="_blank">his MySpace blog</a>. In March, <a href="http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1583774/20080320/id_0.jhtml">the &#8220;Jackass&#8221; star checked into rehab</a> and has been sober for 115 days. But being clean hasn&#8217;t completely cured him of his mood swings and severe depression, which he said led him to back to a mental institution. Steve-O posted the entry after watching himself on &#8220;Dr. Drew&#8217;s Celebrity Addiction Special&#8221; on VH1. &#8220;Everyone&#8217;s going to make their own decisions in life, but nobody needs to make the same mistakes I made,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p><b>&#183;</b> Now that filming has wrapped on <i>High School Musical 3</i>, Vanessa Hudgens can concentrate on promoting her new album, <i>Identified,</i> with her sneakers on. But, she doesn&#8217;t forget about boyfriend, Zac Efron. <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2008-07-06-high-school-musical-3_N.htm" target="_blank">Hudgens told <i>USA Today</i></a> that  their chemistry is just as good offscreen as it is on. &#8220;I&#8217;m such a hopeless romantic.&#8221; she said, adding that the couple are so comfortable in front of each other they can do anything. Let&#8217;s just hope they don&#8217;t take any pictures.  </p>
<p><b>&#183;</b> Fourth of July weekend is barely over, but Beyonc&#233;&#8217;s already got her next one all booked up. She&#8217;s going to headline next year&#8217;s Essence Music Festival, the magazine announced Monday. This year&#8217;s festival, which featured Kanye West and Mary J. Blige, drew a crowd of 270,000 over the weekend. The 2009 festival will coincide with the magazine&#8217;s 15th anniversary and will take place in New Orleans on July 3-5. </p>
<p><b>&#183;</b> Virginia Senator Jim Webb, Vietnam vet and <a href="http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1590428/20080703/id_0.jhtml">sponsor of the new GI Bill</a>, has announced that he won&#8217;t consider becoming Barack Obama&#8217;s running mate, because he feels &#8220;best equipped to serve the people of Virginia and this country&#8221; in the Senate. Well, that&#8217;s a bit firmer than the answer <a href="http://newsroom.mtv.com/2008/04/28/senator-jim-webb-of-virginia-wont-say-no-to-vp-slot/">he gave us back in April</a>.</p>

<p>If you’ve ever wondered how the Hard Rock gets all that cool stuff in their restaurants, then let me introduce you to Don Bernstine, the Hard Rock’s official ambassador of cool. Technically his title is manager of acquisitions/artist relations, but Don just might have the coolest job out there.</p>
<p>Don’s in charge of traveling around the world, hanging out with rock stars and scoring priceless memorabilia for the Hard Rock. Tough job, right? So how does one qualify for such a position? Try working for Deep Purple for a decade for starters. Don is a living witness to rock &#8216;n&#8217; roll history, and he has countless stories to back it up.</p>
<p>My favorite story of Don’s involves a “dream” come true. After dinner at Steven Tyler’s house, the Aerosmith frontman sat down at a white grand piano and began playing “Dream On.” Don got goose bumps. After the song, Steven turned to Don and said, “You know, I really should do something with this piano for you guys.”</p>
<p>“Why?” Don asked.</p>
<p>“Because I wrote the song on this piano,” Steven replied.</p>
<p>To hear some more amazing stories, check out Don’s backstage tour at the Hard Rock Calling festival in London, where he and his team set up a VIP tent that displayed some of the Hard Rock’s rarest items.</p>

<p>Yes, even ladies&#8217; man <a href="http://www.mtv.com/music/artist/mayer_john/artist.jhtml">John Mayer</a> has been dissed.</p>
<p>When we spoke with him recently at England&#8217;s Hard Rock Calling Festival, he recalled having his heart broken &#8230; by <a href="http://www.mtv.com/music/artist/police/artist.jhtml">the Police</a> (the band).</p>
<embed src="http://www.mtv.com/player/embed/wp/" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowFullScreen="true" FlashVars="CONFIG_URL=/player/embed/wp/configuration.jhtml%3fvid%3D254750</center>&allowFullScreen=true" width="400" height="330" AllowScriptAccess="never" base="." /><p><span id="more-1335"></span></p>
<p>In 2003, Mayer had the opportunity to perform with <a href="http://www.mtv.com/music/artist/sting/artist.jhtml">Sting</a> and company at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony. &#8220;Nobody knew they would ever get back together again,&#8221; he told us. &#8220;It was amazing that they were playing onstage and I got asked to go up and sit in with them &#8212; which, even though I know I&#8217;m not supposed to, I&#8217;m going to take advantage of it anyway and let everyone on the blogs discuss that later. I&#8217;m about to go live a dream!&#8221;</p>
<p>Our own Kurt Loder, who was in the house, wasn&#8217;t even sure what <a href="http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1470470/20030311/no_doubt.jhtml">Mayer was doing up there</a>. During that time in 2003, a few of us were swooning to Mayer&#8217;s &#8220;Your Body Is a Wonderland,&#8221; but didn&#8217;t know much else about him. And he wasn&#8217;t even remotely on the radar of the influences he was performing with.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the end we were all bowing and [Police drummer] Stewart Copeland looks over and goes ‘Who the f&#8212; are you?!&#8217;,&#8221; Mayer recalled, laughing. &#8220;And I went, ‘Yeah … that’s about right.”</p>
<p>Copeland probably recognizes Mayer now &#8212; as does anyone who&#8217;s walked past a newsstand in the past two years. But what about you? What&#8217;s your secret shame? Been blown off by a classmate? Stood up for a date? Share: It will make you feel better (if John Mayer can do it, so can you).</p>
